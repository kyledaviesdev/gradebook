# Overview

I wrote a simple gradebook to demonstrate my skill in Java. It allows you to add students, assignments and grades, You can also update those grades if needed.

My purpose in writing this software is to make it so that either a teacher or a student can calculate their grade based on the work they put in.

# Development Environment

In this I used VS Code and the tools they provide on their site such as the JDK (Java Development Kit) they provide and some of the extensions they suggest from Microsoft.

Java is a lot of fun and in VS code it has a nice look as well. It uses similar classes as other coding languages so it was interesting to see how Java puts them to use.
